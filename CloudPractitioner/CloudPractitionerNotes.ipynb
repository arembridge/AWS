    "* **S3 - Intelligent Tiering** - The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. It works by storing objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. For a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object, Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of the objects in S3 Intelligent-Tiering, and moves the ones that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed, it is automatically moved back to the frequent access tier.\n",
    "* **S3 Glacier** - You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying needs, S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours.  Note that you have:\n",

    "An application load balancer is **'application aware'** and able to see into layer 7, meaning that it is able to make intelligent routing decisions to optimize your traffic (e.g. if your website is in French it will distribute across French web servers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Load Balancer\n",
    "This is for when you need optimal performance and static IP addresses.  Best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classic Load Balancer\n",
    "This is the original AWS load balancer and are pretty basic.  Use these to keep costs low.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common issues\n",
    "If the resources behind your load balancer stop working, you will receive a **504 error** - the gateway has timed out.  This could be because of the web server layer, the database layer or something similar.  You will need to identify where the application is failing and scale it up or out.\n",
    "\n",

    "### AWS FAQs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do I decide which load balancer to select for my application?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers. You can select the appropriate load balancer based on your application needs. If you need to load balance **HTTP requests, we recommend you to use Application Load Balancer**. For **network/transport protocols (layer4 – TCP, UDP)** load balancing, and for extreme performance/low latency applications we recommend using **Network Load Balancer**. If your application is built within the EC2 Classic network then you should use Classic Load Balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Can I privately access Elastic Load Balancing APIs from my Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without using public IPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes, you can privately access Elastic Load Balancing APIs from your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) by creating VPC endpoints. With VPC endpoints, the routing between the VPC and Elastic Load Balancing APIs is handled by the AWS network without the need for an Internet gateway, NAT gateway, or VPN connection. The latest generation of VPC Endpoints used by Elastic Load Balancing are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology enabling the private connectivity between AWS services using Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) with private IPs in your VPCs. To learn more about AWS PrivateLink, visit the AWS PrivateLink documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Is there an SLA for load balancers?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes, Elastic Load Balancing guarantees a monthly availability of at least 99.99% for your load balancers (Classic, Application or Network). To learn more about the SLA and know if you are qualified for a credit, visit https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/sla/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Which operating systems does an Application Load Balancer support?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** An Application Load Balancer supports targets with any operating system currently supported by the Amazon EC2 service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Which protocols does an Application Load Balancer support?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** An Application Load Balancer supports load balancing of applications using HTTP and HTTPS (Secure HTTP) protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Is HTTP/2 Supported on an Application Load Balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes. HTTP/2 support is enabled natively on an Application Load Balancer. Clients that support HTTP/2 can connect to an Application Load Balancer over TLS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Is Request tracing supported on an Application Load Balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes. Request tracing is enabled by default on your Application Load Balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Does a Classic Load Balancer have the same features and benefits as an Application Load Balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** While there is some overlap, there is no feature parity between the two types of load balancers. Application Load Balancers are the foundation of our application layer load-balancing platform for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Can I use the existing APIs that I use with my Classic Load Balancer with an Application Load Balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No. Application Load Balancers require a new set of APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Can I convert my Classic Load Balancer to an Application Load Balancer (and vice versa)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No, you cannot convert one load balancer type into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Can I use an Application Load Balancer as a Layer-4 load balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No. If you need Layer-4 features, you should use Network Load Balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q. How can I protect my web applications behind a load balancer from web attacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** You can integrate your Application Load Balancer with AWS WAF, a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from attacks by allowing you to configure rules based on IP addresses, HTTP headers, and custom URI strings. Using these rules, AWS WAF can block, allow, or monitor (count) web requests for your web application. Please see AWS WAF developer guide for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Can I load balance to any arbitrary IP address?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** You can use any IP address from the load balancer’s VPC CIDR for targets within load balancer’s VPC and any IP address from RFC 1918 ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16) or RFC 6598 range (100.64.0.0/10) for targets located outside the load balancer’s VPC (for example, targets in Peered VPC, EC2-Classic and on-premises locations reachable over AWS Direct Connect or VPN connection).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do I enable cross-zone load balancing in Application Load Balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Cross-zone load balancing is already enabled by default in Application Load Balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How does Application Load Balancer pricing work?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** You are charged for each hour or partial hour that an Application Load Balancer is running and the number of Load Balancer Capacity Units (LCU) used per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Will I be billed on Classic Load Balancers by LCU?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** No, Classic Load Balancers will continue to be billed for bandwidth and hourly usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Can I create a TCP or UDP (Layer 4) listener for my Network Load Balancer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** Yes. Network Load Balancers support both TCP, UDP, and TCP+UDP (Layer 4) listeners, as well as TLS listeners.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Which operating systems does the Classic Load Balancer support?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The Classic Load Balancer supports Amazon EC2 instances with any operating system currently supported by the Amazon EC2 service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** Which protocols does the Classic Load Balancer support?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** The Classic Load Balancer supports load balancing of applications using HTTP, HTTPS (Secure HTTP), SSL (Secure TCP) and TCP protocols.\n",
